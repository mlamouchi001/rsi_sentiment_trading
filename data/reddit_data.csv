"What do you think the big come back coins will be in the next bullrun? Coins that got completely clobbered, but have a real reason to make a big comeback. Don't just shill, back it up.  Some of those clobbered coins down by 99% have a really good reason to be down.

Some have just been following the rest of the market.

We could potentially see a few of those clobbered coins make an incredible, maybe even a surprising comeback.

Do you see any hint of which ones could be good candidates for this?

Obviously, there's gonna be a lot of those coins people hate here, because if they got clobbered, people lost a lot of money and they left them more than a bad taste. 

Some of them have also been more heavily FUDed since they tanked. Some for good reasons, some with a little exaggeration. 

It's possible that ""this time it will be different"", and maybe we won't see an alt-coins frenzy that follows the FOMO run of Bitcoin. But that would rely on the expectation that people won't be greedy.

I see a LOT of potential candidates since there's been so many battered alt-coins. Sure, they all have their issues (some big ones), but I can see people eating some of them up in a frenzy during a bullrun.

Even some of the coins I don't like, some with no utility, some with major problems, could potentially be pumped like crazy. 

I think anything that's not called LUNA, Safemoon, or FTT, and hasn't dropped too far and is still in the conversation, probably has a case. 

I'm not gonna post my ""comeback coin"" in the post, I'll post it in the comments like everybody else. I'm not trying to turn this into a shill post.

"Where exactly is all our wallet info stored? When we look at individual cryptos, the crypto itself is stored on the network/blockchain. Your private key is your ownership and access to the crypto which is stored with you, and it links to the public key stored on the network. 

Makes sense. But how does this work with wallets and seeds? 

How does a certain set of words allow me to pull up my multicoin wallet with several different cryptos? 

Where is this information stored? How is it possible that I can use this same seed with another wallet provider and still pull up my wallet with my coins from multiple blockchains (as long as the coins are supported)? 

What network is this information being stored on?

EDIT: I remember in the early days of crypto we would have to save the private key for every coin, but these days we just use wallets. It's probably safer and more convenient to stick with seeds, but is it possible to get the private key for each of my coins using my seed?"

"Nischal Shetty the owner of Wazirx , who claims $230 Million was hacked is working on a new startup called Shardeum. Shardeum appears to be yet another attempt by Nischal Shetty to exploit the crypto industry. This is the same individual who previously ran WazirX, a crypto exchange in India, and one day claimed that $230 million in customer funds had gone missing. His excuse? He ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to store this enormous sum in a cold wallet, a level of negligence that‚Äôs not only irresponsible but hard to believe. The fact that such a large amount was left vulnerable in a hot wallet raises serious questions about his intentions and the security practices of the exchange.

At one point, Shetty also claimed that WazirX had been acquired by Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the owner of Binance, one of the largest and most reputable crypto exchanges in the world. However, when the scandal around the missing funds broke, both Shetty and CZ began to publicly blame each other, shifting responsibility back and forth. This lack of transparency and accountability has led many to suspect that the entire situation may have been a conspiracy between the two, with both parties involved in misleading the public and avoiding culpability.

What‚Äôs even more outrageous is Shetty‚Äôs boldness in now launching Shardeum, a new crypto startup, as if the WazirX debacle never happened. Instead of facing consequences, he‚Äôs moving forward, presenting himself as a legitimate entrepreneur while leaving a trail of victims who have lost their hard-earned money. The fact that someone with such a questionable track record can continue to raise funds and develop new ventures tarnishes the entire crypto space.

People should be extremely cautious about investing in Shetty‚Äôs new project. His past actions indicate a pattern of behavior that prioritizes personal gain over investor security, and there‚Äôs a real risk that history could repeat itself. The crypto community must hold individuals like him accountable to prevent further damage to the industry‚Äôs reputation. Anyone even remotely considering investing in Shardeum should be warned‚Äîthis is not a risk worth taking given his past."

"It's hard to make myself buy at $68k when I missed out on $54k, but gotta keep the big picture in mind! Long story short, I was a wuss and didn't buy as much as I originally set aside during the last few dips out of fear of a macro recession that would cause a crash before the bull run really kicked off.  I was waiting for a lower point of entry.

Now, it looks like BTC is breaking out of the downward trend, and that low point may never arrive.  It could be only up from here.

So, I've decided to DCA that remaining amount in over the next month.  Starting now, at $68k.  Maybe there will be a dip or two along the way, and maybe not.  Who knows what will happen during the election and whatever other macro events might cause some fluctuations.  Who cares.  I can't predict that.

At this point, I have to get over the lost opportunity cost and remember the big picture, which is that by around this time next year, I think BTC is going to be well over $100k.  So really, I'm fretting over choosing between profiting more and profiting less... and in both cases, it's likely going to be profit.  The only situation where it's not profit is if I sit on the sidelines."

Banks have more control over costs and can make upgrades by operating on their own chain. 

And what will connect all these private bank chains? That is the question. "
"Nano is the fastest crypto with settlement time(Time-to-finality) of 0.4 second and it has zero transaction fees. Why is it not more popular? What prevents it attracting more users? Despite Nano being an incredibly fast cryptocurrency with zero transaction fees, it struggles to gain the widespread adoption one might expect. From my perspective it seems like a perfect solution for retailers and consumers alike ‚Äî who wouldn‚Äôt want to save money on fees and benefit from virtually instantaneous transactions? Nano‚Äôs unique advantages should make it highly attractive in comparison to traditional payment methods and many other cryptocurrencies that tend to have higher fees and slower transaction times.

¬†

However, the reality appears to be more complex. One possible explanation for Nano‚Äôs difficulty in gaining traction might lie in the classic chicken-and-egg problem ‚Äî a scenario where both supply and demand rely on each other to grow, but neither is growing independently. For Nano to become more usable and appealing, there needs to be a robust ecosystem of use cases built around it. But here‚Äôs the catch: getting developers and businesses to build those use cases is a challenge when there isn‚Äôt a large, active user base already adopting Nano. Conversely, potential users might sit on the sidelines because they don‚Äôt yet see a diverse range of applications or services that leverage the cryptocurrency.

¬†

This creates a feedback loop of inertia. Developers aren‚Äôt incentivized to build on a platform with a small user base, yet users aren't flocking to the crypto because there aren't enough practical applications or widespread retail adoption for them to justify making the switch. The issue becomes one where Nano is stuck in a state of limbo, waiting on someone ‚Äî developers, businesses, users, or a unique catalyst ‚Äî to break the cycle.

¬†

On top of this, factors like the highly competitive nature of the broader cryptocurrency market, where projects with high-profile marketing teams and better-funded ecosystems tend to dominate attention, could also be playing a role. Despite the clear advantages Nano offers from a technical standpoint, it may struggle to attract attention purely because it doesn‚Äôt have the same hype or visibility as other coins.

¬†

So here‚Äôs a question worth pondering:¬†What do you think explains the lack of larger adoption for Nano?¬†Is it a matter of visibility, marketing, or simply being overshadowed by more hyped rivals? Could it be the relatively slow pace of new functionalities and integrations being built on top of the platform? Or, perhaps, is the cryptocurrency community so saturated with other options, especially ones promising the same goals but with far more hype. Or is the technology bad or just misunderstood? Do people worry it‚Äôs not as safe or reliable as other cryptocurrencies? Or maybe the real issue lies with visibility‚Äîwithout the aggressive marketing and promotional pushes that other cryptocurrencies benefit from, has Nano simply been drowned out by the noise of more popular projects? Could it even be that, despite its advantages, the market finds it too narrowly focused on payments, while others are focused on broader applications like decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs?



Nano's struggles with adoption underscore the difficulties of breaking trough in cryptocurrency ecosystems. Despite its technical superiority in speed and cost, Nano's growth has not been as good as one would expect. Ultimately, the root of Nano's underadoption may not be a single flaw (e.g., technology, safety, or focus), but rather its inability to transcend the cryptocurrency market's inherent noise, fueled by more aggressive marketing and the allure of multifaceted projects."

https://preview.redd.it/p7smg6q32jvd1.jpg?width=886&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b167f0aca6dd350fda9fad4df797906fbeddd21

To be fair, the OP of the first post put in real effort for a pretty convincing analysis, with interesting points. And I gotta give it to him for making a bold prediction like that, and really backing it up.

But we've seen how time and gain this market doesn't care about your logic, news, macros, etc...

**We've seen too many times crypto ignoring the ""logical"" traditional narrative.**

One of the most crazy ones was when Bitcoin ended its bear market and had a breakout during a bunch of worldwide economic crises and an avalanche of FUD.

We've seen great arguments about how Bitcoin can't possibly go up much when we have rate hikes, high inflation, people are struggling to afford anything, we're seeing a recession and an economic crisis, and even threats of a war between China and Taiwan, and threats of nuclear war with Russia. Sprinkle on top of this a little Evergrande, Brexit, the crypto banking collapse, Binance legal woes, the SEC's campaign against crypto, and one FUD after another.

Despite all that, Bitcoin followed its usual script, ignored all that, and had a big breakout from around $20K to $74K.

The breakout happened right at the height of doom and gloom, and ""get ready for the Great Depression 2.0"".

**What do I mean by ""its own dynamics""?**

I think anyone who's been through more than one cycle can start to understand this.

Cryptocurrencies don't quiet work like stocks, gold, commodities, etc... They are decentralized entities, that work with miners and validators, and have their own tokenomic economy heavily affecting supply and demand, and even the market psychology. The psychology is also heavily affected by the heavy volatility.

Furthermore, it's a market in still a very unique situation where there is one single coin heavily dominating the market, and one system of mining and tokenomics as the hegemon of the market.

""This time is different"" and ""it's priced in this time"" doesn't quiet work here. This market has the memory of a fish and keeps repeating the same mistakes. It's the market that keeps on rhyming and following similar cycles and behavior.

But don't look for an exact linear repetition. It doesn't work in a straight line, nor with exact same quantities. Things cycle in ratios, in a curve, and with elements tapering down. Even short term, the volatility seems to have repeating behavior, going through the same types of phases.

**The emotions are strong in this market, hence the overreaction.**

It's historically a very volatile market.

Traditional market already have a lot of emotions and overreaction. Take people who already can't handle traditional markets, and put them on this rollercoaster and you'll get emotional overreaction on steroids.

This is also why whenever there is a small candle down, it's all doom and gloom like it's the Great Depression or almost the apocalypse.

And when there's a small green candle it's back to ""are we all gonna retire early?""."

"I Analyzed the Compounding Effect of BTC and S&P 500, and Oh My God... **I'm not going to waste your time, so here's everything briefly.**

* Since 1957, the S&P 500 has delivered an average annual return of 10%.
* Bitcoin has shown an average annual growth rate of around 100% since 2011. Though its growth has slowed to an average of 46.59% since 2017, Bitcoin still offers substantial upside. For a conservative estimate, I used a ~~40%~~ 25% annual growth rate.
* Over 10 years, a $10,000 investment in VOO, which tracks the S&P 500, would grow to $25,937.42‚Äîroughly 2.6 times the initial amount. The same investment in Bitcoin could potentially grow to ~~$289,254.65~~ $93,132.26, achieving a 9.31x return.
* Looking at a 20-year horizon, $10,000 in the S&P 500 could increase to $67,275. In contrast, the same investment in Bitcoin could exceed ~~$8.3 million~~ $867K.

* If you're ~~extremely~~ conservative and want minimal exposure to Bitcoin, then over the past five years, allocating just 10% to Bitcoin and 90% to the S&P 500 would have¬†**~~doubled the returns~~**¬†**increased the returns by 36.68%** compared to a full allocation to the S&P 500. A balanced approach, with 50% in each, would have resulted in¬†**more than triple the growth.**

EDIT 1: I‚Äôve noticed a lot of comments saying this analysis is garbage, pure hopium, or just plain stupid. I want to clarify what the chart is actually showing‚Äîthe power of compounding. Even a small change in the annual growth rate (say, 10% versus 15%) can make a huge difference in long-term returns.

Yes, I get that maintaining a 40% growth rate for 40 years is unrealistic‚Äîthat‚Äôs on me for not pointing it out earlier. I apologize for the oversight. In my opinion, though, a 40% growth rate could still be achievable for another decade or so before tapering off to around 25-30%, and eventually settling at about 20%. Even at a steady 20% per year, the compounding effect remains incredibly impactful. You can choose whichever % return you want using the table. Thank you for all the critique, I truly value all of your words, even the extremely negative ones.

EDIT 2: I‚Äôve removed ""extremely conservative"" from the last bullet point, as it seemed to cause confusion.  
EDIT 3: Changed the estimates to 25% CAGR and 10% exposure. "

"Crypto is like AI art. Stolen, fraudulent, vacuous. Have y'all considered putting this energy instead into contributing to society? I cofounded a food bank in 2018. We were never able to get nonprofit status for various reasons. We fed thousands of vulnerable people. Young kids got a decent school lunch because of our efforts. Single moms with abusive ex partners got to sleep a bit easier.

Food for thought.

When I see stories of people making huge amounts of money off crypto currencies my soul grimaces. Humble folks didn't have a chance to get rich off crypto. In the early stages when it was cheap it was a joke that had no relevance to society. When it became relevant it became expensive. Humble folks were busy making ends meet, they had no disposable income to buy it with, they didn't know it existed.

Crypto just an abstraction of capital. A concept of a concept. Sadly also very tangible. That capital stems from the labour of the proletariat and the global south. So y'all sit back and buy chunguscoin or whatever the fuck is the new trend these days and occasionally get very wealthy. It gets interpreted as an abstraction in order to keep the humble people of the world from getting their their share. Y'all are just reinforcing a toxic system.

Bitcoin is currently worth 93,462.54

What the fuck does that even mean
